# How to use the functions defined in the python program
This file will go through the individual functions defined in the "Evaluation.py" file, which was created to plot and fit the data of my bachelors thesis. I will roughly explain what each function does and can be used for. Additionally, examples on how to run the functions and inputs to each will be given.
